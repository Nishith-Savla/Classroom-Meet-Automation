# Classroom Meet Automation

This project opens the google classroom, finds the google meet in the respective classroom's header section and opens the meet tab automatically

For this you'll need a chromedriver which you can download from here : [ChromeDriver Download](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) 
Make sure to check your google chrome version by typing **chrome://version** in the address bar

Replace the email-id, password and chromedriver path with yours and you're just a little away from executing it.

Finally replace the xpath of the classes in the classPath function. You can find them by inspecting the classroom page.
